DETAILED LEGEND DESCRIPTION

Description of the categories assigned to each citizen report in the map (see map legend).

*Tiger mosquito*: it includes reports from citizen tagged by them as "adult mosquito", that contain at least one picture and that it has been evaluated by entomological experts. According to these experts, the picture/s of this observation could be tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus): their taxonomic features can be clearly seen in the picture/s, especially the white stripe on head and thorax; or only some characteristic features can be observed, but it could be this species nonetheless.

*Yellow fever mosquito*: it includes reports from citizen tagged by them as "adult mosquito", that contain at least one picture and that it has been evaluated by entomological experts. According to these experts, the picture/s of this observation could be yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti): their taxonomic features can be clearly seen in the picture/s, especially the lyre in the head and thorax; or only some characteristic features can be observed, but it could be this species nonetheless.

*Other species*: it includes reports from citizen tagged by them as "adult mosquito", that contain at least one picture and that it has been evaluated by entomological experts. According to these experts, the pictures of this observation may be of other species of mosquito.

*Unidentifiable*: it includes all reports from citizen tagged by them as "adult mosquito" that don't contain any picture attached and therefore, could not be evaluated by entomological experts. It also includes reports from citizen tagged by them as "adult mosquito", that contain at least one picture and that it has been evaluated by entomological experts. According to these experts, these observations and their photo/s do not help identify any particular species of mosquito (experts cannot decide on any other category according to the content of the pictures).

*Breeding sites*: storm drain with or without water*: citizens' observations of possible breeding sites (storm drain) of tiger or yellow fever mosquitoes. It includes reports that contain at least one picture and that it has been evaluated by entomological experts, reports with at least one picture that have not been evaluated by experts and it might also contain reports without pictures. 


DETAILED FIELD DESCRIPTION

Description of each field found in the downloadable data base

*ID*: unique identifier for each observation. UUID randomly generated on phone to identify each unique report version. Must be exactly 36 characters (32 hex digits plus 4 hyphens). This corresponds to the latest version of the report (as opposed to an earlier version that the participant subsequently edited). Example: 8664a3b2-7646-42ab-8c7b-475245ac88db.

*Date*: creation date and time of the observation. Date and time on phone when first version of report was created, converted to UTC time zone 0. Format as YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. Example: 2016-07-31 17:39:12.

*Longitude*: longitude of report location in decimal degrees. Participants select the location on a map, or use GPS and other Smartphone services to record their current location at the time of the observation. Accuracy or precision of the coordinates cannot be specified for each particular case, because it depends on many factors (each participant's device, specific day of recording, network coverage, GPS availability, etc.). Example: -0.4045194.

*Latitude*: latitude of report location in decimal degrees. Participants select the location on a map, or use GPS and other Smartphone services to record their current location at the time of the observation. Accuracy or precision of the coordinates cannot be specified for each particular case, because it depends on many factors (each participant's device, specific day of recording, network coverage, GPS availability, etc.). Example: 39.55819.

*Ref. System*: Reference System of the Geographic Coordinates (latitude, longitude) in EPSG:4326. Example: WGS84.

*Municipality*: Municipality where the citizen report is located. Ex: Sabadell.

*Type*: type of report. 'Adult' or 'site', depending on the app button that the participant selected to send the observation. Example: adult.

*Expert validated*: it is a zero if the report has not been validated by entomology experts and 1, if yes. More information on the validation method on the project website. Example: 0.

*Expert validation result*: Possible values are "mosquito_tiger_confirmed", "mosquito_tiger_probable", "yellow_fever_confirmed", "yellow_fever_probable", "other_species", "unidentified", "storm_drain_water", "storm_drain_dry"

*Map link*: an HTML string that produces a small version of the selected report. Example:
